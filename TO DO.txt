TO DO

make name and date entry field? (or add date/time to fancy filename)
Screenshot feature
Video controls: better styling + loop, mute, ff, and rw buttons
    SVGs for play/pause
SVGs are blurry (currently drawn as images), need better rendering/handling
    fabric.loadSVGFromURL(
    or just make text (copy from file)
Make horizontal scroll (for more than 8 elements), pinning canvas 2 and 3 together

    <div style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 600px; overflow: scroll;">
        <canvas id="canvas2" width="1200" height="400" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; z-index: 1;"></canvas>
    </div>
Finish relationship category and create symbols
Flexible entry and search
Alphabetize element lists

cleanup/refactoring:

when adding an emotion button -- need to streamline, everything is hardcoded [like, an array with sadness, elements, number etc]
when adding videos -- need to streamline, everything is hardcoded [like an array for subjects vs videos vs labels]
